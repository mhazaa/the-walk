### Old project, legacy code
# The Walk
https://magdihazaa.com/work/the-walk

The Walk is an interactive side-scrolling website that tells the story of a kid helping his friend deal with grief. The story is told through text as the two kids explore the woods where one of them used to walk his recently-deceased dog. I started by writing the text and creating the vector-based visuals with Adobe Illustrator, along with some post-processing in Photoshop. For the code, I used HTML/CSS for the responsive layout, and vanilla JavaScript to control the movement and interactivity.
